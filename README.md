# 🎯 Job Recommendation System

An ML-powered job recommendation system using TF-IDF and cosine similarity on a dataset of 147+ real-world job roles from Kaggle.

**Built by:** Rameen Zehra

---

## 📋 Overview

This system uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to match user input with job descriptions from a curated dataset of 50+ tech roles. Users enter their skills (e.g., "python machine learning") and receive the top 3 most relevant job recommendations.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and CSV handling
- **scikit-learn** - TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
- **Streamlit** - Interactive web interface

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Loading:** Reads job titles and descriptions from CSV
2. **Text Preprocessing:** Combines job title + description into unified text
3. **Vectorization:** Converts text to numerical vectors using TF-IDF
4. **Similarity Matching:** Compares user input with all jobs using cosine similarity
5. **Ranking:** Returns top 3 jobs with highest similarity scores

**ML Pipeline:**
```
User Input → TF-IDF Transform → Cosine Similarity → Top 3 Recommendations
```
